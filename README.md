Hey there. If you're reading this your probably wondering "What the heck is Track the Track?" Well Track the Track is an open-sourced Track+Field event tracker. I wanted to work on this because I know that sometimes track meets can be extremely confusing for the audience. I hope that this application can be helpful towards the audience instead of asking "What event is this?" to answering that question! 

Features I hope to add:
- Tracking events LIVE
- Tracking what atheletes are in the race/event
- Tracking when an event starts and ends
- Tracking LIVE RESULTS
- Easy to use interface for older audience members
- Easy integration for coaches/timers/officials/audience members/Atheles
